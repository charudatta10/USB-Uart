# USB-Uart
Verilog module for USB UART interface with RTS/CTS hardware handshake protocol

This is a part of my verilog learning experience.
Most of this project has been derived from http://www.fpga4fun.com/SerialInterface.html
The module has been adapted to take care of RTS/CTS handshaking.

It has been implemented on the Xilinx SPARTAN-6 FPGA SP605 evaluation kit.
